Stranger Danger
For this challenge, the input will be a (long) string.

A word encountered for the first time is a stranger. A word encountered thrice becomes an acquaintance. A word encountered 5 times becomes a friend.

Create a function that takes the string and returns a list of two lists. The first is a list of acquaintances in the order they became an acquaintance (see example). The second is a list of friends in the order they became a friend. Words on the friend list should no longer be on the acquaintance list.

Examples
no_strangers("See Spot run. See Spot jump. Spot likes jumping. See Spot fly.")
➞ [["spot", "see"], []]
# "see" was encountered first, but "spot" became an acquaintance earlier.
Notes
All words should be in lowercase.
Punctuation should be stripped except for apostrophes (e.g. doesn't, aren't, etc).

You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.
